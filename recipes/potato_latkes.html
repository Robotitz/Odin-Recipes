    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 medium russet potatoes, peeled</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated onion</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup peanut oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>step 1 <br></h4>
            <p> Slice peeled potatoes and run through a food processor fitted with the grater attachment. Place shredded potatoes in a cheesecloth and wring, extracting as much moisture as possible. </p>
        <li><h4>Step 2 <br></h4>
            <p>Measure 2 cups shredded, drained potatoes and place into a medium bowl; save any extra for another use. Add egg, flour, onion, and salt, and stir until well combined.</p>
        <li><h4>Step 3<br></h4>
            <p>Heat 1/4 inch of oil in a large, heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat. Place large spoonfuls of potato mixture into the hot oil, pressing down on them to form 1/4- to 1/2-inch-thick patties. Cook until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip and repeat on the other side. </p>
        <li><h4>Step 4 <br></h4>
            <p>            <p>Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. Pour 1/4 of the batter into the preheated iron and cook until waffle is crisp and golden, about 5 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter. </p></li></p>
